# Batmobile (explorer/navigator)
#### V1.0.9
## Description
Batmobile itself does not do anything, but it provides other plugins to utilize it for exploring and path finding.
For exploration:
    - it normalizes coordinate system to 0.5 accuracy
    - it uses DFS and closests direction to previous target to choose exploration target
    - it passes the target to A* pathfinder to find the best route to target

Batmobile also handles any traversals in game if move command is given.

## Settings
- Toggle Drawings -- toggle to draw path, backtrack and status
- Use movement spells -- toggle to use movement spell as part of movement or not
- Reset Batmobile -- keybind to reset visited, frontier, backtrack, path and retries

### Movement spells
- checkboxes for movement spells available to your class. requires "Use movement spells" to be toggled on.

### Debug
- Toggle Explorer -- toggle to freeroam with explorer
- Logging -- set log level

## Example integrations
TBD (Arkham Asylum is integrated, so check there in the mean time)
